Hoare (British computer scientist, winner of the 1980 Turing Award) | “There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult.” |

As you’re about to add a comment, ask yourself, ‘How can I improve the code so that this comment isn’t needed?'” |

| [![Victor Laerte](https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7623098?s=70)](https://github.com/victorlaerte) <br> Edsger Wybe Dijkstra (Computer scientist and an early pioneer in many research areas of computing science. Turing Award Winner) | “Raise your quality standards as high as you can live with, avoid wasting your time on routine problems, and always try to work as closely as possible at the boundary of your abilities. Do this, because it is the only way of discovering how that boundary should be moved foward.” |
