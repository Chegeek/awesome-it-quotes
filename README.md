Do this, because it is the only way of discovering how that boundary should be moved foward.” | <div id="edsger-dijkstra"></div> [![Edsger Dijkstra](images/edsger_dijkstra.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra) <br> Edsger Wybe Dijkstra (Computer scientist and an early pioneer in many research areas of computing science.

To where science took this whole notion of developing ideas in the open and improving on other peoples' ideas and making it into what science is today and the incredible advances that we have had.
