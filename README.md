| “There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult.” | [![Tony Hoare](images/tony_hoare.jpg?s=70)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare) <br> Tony Hoare (British computer scientist, winner of the 1980 Turing Award) |
| “Raise your quality standards as high as you can live with, avoid wasting your time on routine problems, and always try to work as closely as possible at the boundary of your abilities.
